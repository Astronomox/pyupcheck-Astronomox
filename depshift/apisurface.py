"""Extract and diff the public API surface between two versions of a package.

This is the accuracy core of pyupcheck. Instead of guessing breaking changes
from changelog prose, we download both versions, extract their actual public
API (modules, classes, functions, and signatures), and compute a precise diff:
what was removed, what changed signature, what parameters disappeared.
